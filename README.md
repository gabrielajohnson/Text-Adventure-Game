# Text-Adventure-Game 

I created this text based adventure game using Python, which can be played using Terminal. The game takes place in a castle, where two castle workers are trapped in its mirrors. It is up to the user to save them by collecting and combining objects around the castle to create and do what is needed to free them.

How to Play

1. Download repository
2. Open Terminal and change directory into repository folder
3. Run the command "python FinalAdventureGame.py"
